## 🎨 Godetia Style

The Godetia Style is a set of style conventions for writing Godot programs.

* Each class should be its own file.
* Avoid default values for class members.
* Procedures that are likely to fail should return an error value.
* Use `assert(false)` to indicate that something should not happen.
